## Description

Whenever someone accesss a website, the first thing that is seen is a landing page. A landing page's purpose is to attract users and keep them hooked to the website. In order to accomplish this goal, the page has to look good. Making everything on the page easily visible to viewers is important in making a good landing page. Companies want to pull customers in and the first thing that they focus on online is this page. Knowing this, I wanted to take on the challenge of building something that is applicable to real world situations. I used the bentley motors website as inspiration.

To build the landing page, I implemented a slider. What the slider does is that it holds each slide's content. In this project, there are three slides and each of them come after each other in a loop. The slides are animated as the page loads in. The small circles on the left fill in every time a new slide enters the frame as well as the links detailing the name of the car models towards the right. The images of the cars, large numbers, slogans, and descriptions fade in. There is a bar that runs from left to right before the next slide appears.

Creating the landing page taught me about real world applications. People deal with landing page issues all the time and need someone to fix their issues. Animations were important in creating a good viewing experience. I experimented with how low long each animation should last and how should each animation appear. I thought about what images I should include and what type of content I should add in each slide.
